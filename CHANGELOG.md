## Development Notes

This project was developed using Test-Driven Development principles with Claude Code, following a structured approach:

1. **Requirements Analysis** - Detailed specification based on user needs
2. **Test Design** - Comprehensive test suite covering all functionality
3. **Implementation** - Code written to pass tests without modification
4. **Verification** - Independent review and gap analysis
5. **Enhancement** - Critical missing components added

All tests pass and the implementation is ready for production use.
